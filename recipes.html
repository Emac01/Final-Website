<br><br><br><br><br>
    <p class="p6"> These chewy, sweet and savory cookies are such a good
    <br>snack for a nice treat after a long day of work. They stay soft
    <br>and chewy, with the most amazing taste of velvety chocolate. The
    <br>brown butter adds an aromatic, soft buttery taste to the overall
    <br>cookie. This is one of the recipes I've ever tried!
